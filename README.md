# Online_News_Popularity_Prediction_using_ML
This project aims to develop a classification model using various machine learning algorithms, including AdaBoost Classifier, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, GaussianNB, Support Vector Classifier, KNeighborsClassifier, and Decision Tree. The goal is to predict the popularity of online news articles using the UCI Online News Popularity dataset. 
By analyzing features such as the number of words, social media shares, article category, sentiment analysis scores, and others, the model provides valuable insights for publishers and content creators to optimize their content strategy. 
The dataset is preprocessed, relevant features are extracted, and the classification models are trained and evaluated. The results and discussions showcase the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in accurately classifying the popularity of online news articles.
